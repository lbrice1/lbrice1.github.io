SimWiz
======
SimWiz is an interactive platform containing a suite of virtual plants ranging from single units and plant sections to full processing plants. Developed in Python and powered by an industry standard process simulator, SimWiz emulates a DCS environment to operate and visualize chemical plants in different scenarios, as well as easily collect and analyze data. The user interface is fully menu-based so that users are not required to have any knowledge of a specific programming language. Because of its modularity, SimWiz can be used across the entire Chemical Engineering curricula.
