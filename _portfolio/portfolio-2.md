PEMNET
======
Widespread adoption of high-temperature electrochemical systems such as polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs) requires models and computational tools for accurate optimization and guiding new materials for enhancing fuel cell performance and durability. While robust and better suited for extrapolation, knowledge-based modeling has limitations as it is time consuming and requires information about the system that is not always available (e.g., material properties and interfacial behavior between different materials). Data-driven modeling on the other hand, is easier to implement, but often necessitates large datasets that could be difficult to obtain. In this contribution, knowledge-based modeling and data-driven modeling are combined by implementing a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) approach. A knowledge-based model originally developed for a HT-PEMFC was used to generate simulated data (887,735 points) and used to pretrain a neural network source model tuned via a genetic algorithm-based AutoML.
