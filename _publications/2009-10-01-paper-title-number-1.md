title: "Machine learning for guiding high-temperature PEM fuel cells with greater power density"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'A multilevel modeling and data analysis framework were constructed for high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs) and their electrolyte materials. The framework employed Machine Learning tools (e.g., support vector regression, dimension reduction, and clustering) that seamlessly linked materials characteristics with fuel cell device performance and design, allowing for the accelerated discovery of material property attributes and fuel cell operating parameters and configurations that achieve greater power density and efficiency while co-currently addressing costs.'
