collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-04-25-dce
excerpt: 'Data mining and knowledge discovery (DMKD) can be a powerful tool in the analysis of chemical plant data. However, method selection and implementation can be a difficult task. In this contribution, all stages of the DMKD process are considered in detail, examining the fundamentals of various methods as well as practical insights on how to select and tune these methods. Both simulated and real plant data are analyzed to showcase the properties of data cleaning, sampling, scaling, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and cluster analysis, and their applicability in real-life scenarios. Also, a friendly graphic user interface to implement DMKD is presented.'
