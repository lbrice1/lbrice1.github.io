excerpt: 'Widespread adoption of high-temperature electrochemical systems such as polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs) requires models and computational tools for accurate optimization and guiding new materials for enhancing fuel cell performance and durability. While robust and better suited for extrapolation, knowledge-based modeling has limitations as it is time-consuming and requires information about the system that is not always available (e.g., material properties and interfacial behavior between different materials). Data-driven modeling, on the other hand, is easier to implement but often necessitates large datasets that could be difficult to obtain. In this contribution, knowledge-based modeling and data-driven modeling are combined by implementing a few-shot learning (FSL) approach. A knowledge-based model originally developed for a HT-PEMFCs was used to generate simulated data (887,735 points) and used to pretrain a neural network source model tuned via a genetic algorithm-based AutoML. Then, experimental datasets from HT-PEMFCs with different materials and operating conditions (∼50 points each) were used to train six target models via FSL. Models for the unseen data reached high accuracies in all cases (rRMSE < 10%).'
