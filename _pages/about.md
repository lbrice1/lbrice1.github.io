I am PhD candidate at Louisiana State University working on Process Systems Engineering and Machine Learning. My research focuses on hybrid modeling using ML-based surrogate models and how to deal with scarce availability of data.

Areas of interest
======
1. Multiscale modeling
2. Hybrid Modeling
3. Machine Learning-based surrogate modeling
4. Transfer Learning for data-driven modeling with scarce availability of data
5. Systems design and optimization

Research philosophy
------
I aim for my research to be interdisciplinary and application oriented. I am convinced that solving our world's big problems such as climate change, energy generation and distribution, drinking and wastewater management, requires the convergence of many fields of expertise, and a pragmatic vision to bring effective solutions to large scale applications.
