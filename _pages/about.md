I am a Chemical Engineer working on on hybrid modeling to tackle challenges in process and product development. I got my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Costa Rica, with an undergraduate thesis on reactor engineering for advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment. I worked as a lecturer for the School of Chemical Engineering at the University of Costa Rsica, teaching statistics, thermodynamics, and reaction kinetics. I received the degree of Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Louisiana State University. My dissertation work studied hybrid modeling for the understanding and optimization of electrochemical systems. 

I am also the co-author of [AI in Chemical Engineering: Unlocking the Power Within Data](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003455905/ai-chemical-engineering-josé-romagnoli-luis-briceño-mena-vidhyadhar-manee).

Areas of interest
======
1. Multiscale modeling
2. Hybrid Modeling & Scientific AI
3. Machine Learning-based surrogate modeling
4. Transfer Learning for data-driven modeling with scarce availability of data
5. Systems design and optimization

Research
------
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Chemical Engineering presents an opportunity to enhance process efficiency, accelerate materials discovery, and optimize industrial operations. My research focuses on leveraging AI-driven approaches, including machine learning, hybrid modeling, and optimization, to tackle complex challenges in chemical processes. By combining fundamental chemical engineering principles with state-of-the-art computational techniques, I aim to develop innovative solutions that advance both theoretical understanding and practical applications in the field.
