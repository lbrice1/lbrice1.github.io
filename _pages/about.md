I am PhD student at Louisiana State University working on Process Systems Engineering and Machine Learning. My research focuses on multiscale modeling using ML-based surrogate models and how to deal with scarce availability of data. I am also interested in teaching and learning in Chemical Engineering.

Areas of interest
======
1. Multiscale modeling
2. Machine Learning-based surrogate modeling
3. Transfer Learning for data-driven modeling with scarce availability of data
4. Process design and optimization
5. Teaching in Chemical Engineering

Research philosophy
------
My research is interdisciplinary and application oriented. I am conviced that solving our world's big problems such as climate change, energy generation and distribution, drinking and wastewater management, requires the convergence of many fields of expertise, and a pragmatic vision to bring effective solutions to large scale applications.

Teaching philosophy
------
I believe that every student that comes to our classroom deserves every and all opportunities to learn and succeed. Therefore, it is our job as educators to build a learning enviroment in which all backgrounds and experiences are recognized, welcomed and cherished.
