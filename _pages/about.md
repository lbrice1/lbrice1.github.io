I am a Chemical Engineer working on on hybrid modeling to tackle challenges in process and product development. I got my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Costa Rica, with an undergraduate thesis on reactor engineering for advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment. I worked as a lecturer for the School of Chemical Engineering at the University of Costa Rica, teaching statistics, thermodynamics, and reaction kinetics. I received the degree of Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Louisiana State University. My dissertation work studied hybrid modeling for the understanding and optimization of electrochemical systems. 

I am also the co-author of [AI in Chemical Engineering: Unlocking the Power Within Data](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003455905/ai-chemical-engineering-josé-romagnoli-luis-briceño-mena-vidhyadhar-manee).

Areas of interest
======
1. Multiscale modeling
2. Hybrid Modeling & Scientific AI
3. Machine Learning-based surrogate modeling
4. Transfer Learning for data-driven modeling with scarce availability of data
5. Systems design and optimization

Research philosophy
------
I aim for my research to be interdisciplinary and application oriented. I am convinced that solving our world's big problems such as climate change, energy generation and distribution, drinking and wastewater management, requires the convergence of many fields of expertise, and a pragmatic vision to bring effective solutions to large scale applications.
