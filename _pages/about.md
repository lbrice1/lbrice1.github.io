I am PhD student at Louisiana State University working on Process Systems Engineering and Machine Learning. My research focuses on multiscale modeling using ML-based surrogate models and how to deal with scarce availability of data.

Areas of interest
======
1. Multiscale modeling
2. Machine Learning-based surrogate modeling
3. Transfer Learning for data-driven modeling with scarce availability of data
4. Process design and optimization
5. Teaching in Chemical Engineering

Teaching philosophy
------
I believe that every student that comes to our classroom deserve every and all opportunities to learn and succeed. Therefore, it is our job as educators to create an learning enviroment in which al backgrounds and experiences are welcomed and cherished.
