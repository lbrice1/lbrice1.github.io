The use of continuous reactors for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation is yet to be explored in order to develop a viable technology for industrial applications. This poster presents a kinetic and hydrodynamic study on the use of a co-current down flow trickle bed reactor for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of phenol (as model pollutant) over a Fe/Diatomite based catalyst and a Fe/Glass based catalyst. It was found that the reactor could operate under trickle and pulsing flow regimes with high liquid distribution. The results showed that phenol conversion increases by 6.4% (up to 19.7%, Ï„=0.098 min) when using the Fe/Diatomite based catalyst and that mass transfer appears to be the controlling step in the heterogeneous reaction.
